                <h3>What is the definition of public health in its broadest sense?</h3>
                <p>
                The World Health Organization defines public health as “all organized measures (whether public or private) to prevent disease, promote health, and prolong life among the population as a whole.”

                <p>
                A public health problem usually fulfills three criteria of the public, government, or public health authorities:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A condition or situation exists that is a widespread actual or potential cause of morbidity or mortality</li>
                    <li> Costs to community and to individuals are great.</li>
                    <li>Effective methods available to prevent, alleviate or cure.</li>

                <h3>Describe the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and its role in dental practice.</h3>
                <p>
                The mission of OSHA is to ensure the safety and health of U.S. workers. As part of the Department of Labor, OSHA and the states that operate OSHA-approved state plans establish guidelines and standards to promote worker safety and health that apply to every workplace, including medical and dental offices. The work practice control, engineering control, and personal protective equipment regulations are examples of OSHA safety topics that have a direct impact on dental infection control. The regulations designed to protect the dental health care worker often translate into increased safety for the dental patient.
