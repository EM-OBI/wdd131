                <p>
                Dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI) is a condition caused by abnormal dentin formation and several types exist. The classic type lead to opalescent teeth in the primary and permanent dentition. The teeth are bluish-brown and translucent. Enamel is lost early, and the exposed dentine undergoes rapid attrition. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type I, radicular type. </strong>The roots are poorly formed, short, and distorted or even absent, with poorly formed crescent-shaped pulp chambers and absent pulp canals. Periapical lucencies develop early and teeth exfoliate prematurely</li>
                    <li><strong>Type II, coronal type. </strong>The crowns contain large pulp chambers that are thistle- or flameshaped, that extend into the root. Pulp stones often develop. Primary teeth look like those of dentinogenesis imperfect with early obliteration of the pulp.</li>

                <h3>What is the difference between fusion and concrescence? Between twinning and gemination?</h3>
                <p>
                Fusion is a more complete process than concrescence and involves fusion of the entire
                length of two teeth (enamel, dentin, and cementum) to form one large tooth, with one
                less tooth in the arch, or fusion of the root only (dentin and cementum), with the maintenance of two clinical crowns. Concrescence involves fusion of cementum only.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                Twinning is more complete than gemination and results in the formation of two separate teeth from one tooth bud (one extra tooth in the arch). In gemination, separation is
                attempted, but the two teeth share the same root canal.

                <h3>What is a Turner tooth?</h3>
                <p>
                A Turner tooth is a solitary, usually permanent tooth with signs of enamel hypoplasia or hypocalcification. This phenomenon is caused by trauma or infection in the overlying deciduous tooth that damages the ameloblasts of the underlying tooth bud and thus leads to localized enamel hypoplasia or hypocalcification.
